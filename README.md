# Kittysay, a shitty cowsay copy

kittysay is a cowsay copy implemented in C. I pretty much is the same as cowsay but without any
of the functionality of it (if cowsay ever had practical use to begin with).

kitty say will simply put your input text into a somewhat formatted box and it will put 
put a cat as if it was the one saying it, you can actuallyy change the cat! (enjoy yoer 30 characters
of pure ascii freedom).
